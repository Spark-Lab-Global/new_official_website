          {`We feel a deep sense of disillusionment with today’s startup culture.

            The romantic era of entrepreneurship seems to be over — or perhaps, in China, the hacker spirit never truly began.
            
            This era cares too much about the pitch, and too little about the motive.
            
            Too obsessed with markets, and blind to obsession.
            
            If something excites you — even if it brings no prestige or polish — but you can articulate its overlooked value, then not only is it worth doing, you should give it everything you’ve got. We believe that everyone
            carries what we call a Spark — a fire that lives deep within.
            
            We believe the most compelling founders aren’t drawn by profit, but are captivated by the world they’re building.
            
            We believe the most moving creations are born from those who dare to deviate, and stay true to themselves.
            
            We believe innovation and courage always shine brightest in individuals who choose their own path.
            
            They are the real heroes.

            We believe that real creation needs a space that welcomes deviation and fuels co-burning — a space that is honest, open, and safe enough for exploration to happen, for sparks to be lit, and for them to spread through mutual ignition.
            
            Everything begins with a Spark.

            A life and a world shaped by the things that truly excite us.
