- 有人在活动现场被投资人当场看中，直接获得投资
- 有人用技术治愈那个曾经的自己，打造具有温度的产品
- 有人在拿到顶级基金的投资后，选择在 Spark Lab 重新出发
- 有人成功筹集近百万美金的种子资金
- 有人实现项目商业化，年收入接近百万

……

Spark Lab 是一个 builder 永不毕业的地方，他们不只是校友，他们是共同写作未来的一群人。

    "d4.content": `Spark Lab was never meant to be a one-off program — it’s a collective creation that continues to burn.
Over the past year, we’ve witnessed nearly 70 young builders, aged 15 to 21, collide, connect, and rise.
Among them:

- Nearly half chose to take a gap year or drop out, firmly committing to the path of entrepreneurship
- Most started their first startup at just 16 or 17
- One built and successfully sold an open-source tool with nearly 10,000 GitHub stars — at age 15
- Another grew an audience of over 70,000 followers by documenting their building journey
- Some received investments on the spot during our events
- One turned their own pain into empathy-driven products that help others heal
- One restarted their journey at Spark Lab — even after being funded by a top-tier VC
- Some raised close to $1M in seed funding
- Some built profitable startups earning nearly $1M in annual revenue
- One, just 14 years old, created a website with 300K monthly visits — while battling illness, still driven by a mission to contribute to humanity
- Another built and shipped 22 projects in a single year — just to find that one true spark
…

At Spark Lab, builders never “graduate.”
They’re more than alumni — they’re the ones writing the future, together.
