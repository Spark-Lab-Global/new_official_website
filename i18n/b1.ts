我们对当下的创业文化有一种强烈的失落感。

创业的浪漫时代似乎结束了。

这个时代太在意 pitch，不在意动机。太看重市场，不看见执念。

如果一件事让你兴奋不已，即使它并非意味着体面或者声望，但你能阐明它被普遍忽视的价值，那么它不仅值得去做，你应该为它倾注一切。

在 Spark Lab ，我们始终坚守几条简单却顽固的判断：
每个人身上一定存在着我们所说的 Spark，那是你内心深处的那团火。
真正成功的创始人，不是被利益吸引，而是对他们正在构建的世界深深着迷。
最动人的创造，往往诞生于那些敢于偏离、忠于自我的人。
创新与勇气始终在每一个选择独特道路的个体身上闪耀，他们是真正的英雄。
真正的创造，离不开一块能承载「偏离」与「共燃」的土壤—— 一个真实、开放、足够安全的时空，让探索得以发生，火花得以点燃，并在彼此的燃烧中持续蔓延。

我们寻找那些不合常规的年轻创造者，与其建立基于真实表达与共同信仰的信任链，并邀请他们进入 Spark Lab ——一个把审美当作判断力，把创作当作信仰的地方

Everything begins with a Spark
创造令我们兴奋的事物和生活方式

We feel a deep sense of disillusionment with today’s startup culture.
The romantic era of entrepreneurship seems to be over.

This era cares too much about the pitch, and too little about the motive.
 Too obsessed with markets, and blind to obsession.

If something excites you — even if it brings no prestige or polish —
 but you can articulate its overlooked value,
 then not only is it worth doing,
 you should give it everything you’ve got.

At Spark Lab, we hold fast to a few simple yet unshakable beliefs:
There is always a spark within every person — a fire buried deep inside.
 The most successful founders aren’t driven by profit,
 But by an obsession with the world they feel compelled to build.
The most powerful creations are born from those who dare to diverge,
 And stay true to themselves.
Innovation and courage shine brightest in individuals who choose the road less taken —
 They are real heroes.
True creation requires soil that can hold both divergence and shared ignition —
 A space that is real, open, and safe enough for exploration to happen,
 For sparks to catch,
 And for flames to spread through the fire of others.

We seek unconventional young creators —
 those with whom we can build a trust chain rooted in honest expression and shared conviction.
 And we invite them into Spark Lab —
 a place where aesthetics is judgment, and creation is belief.

Everything begins with a Spark.
 A life and a world shaped by the things that truly excite us.
